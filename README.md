## General information
- This is a "Unity" game project of my arcade game inspired by "[Hamsterball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamsterball "Hamsterball - Wikipedia")", a popular arcade game developed by **Raptisoft Games** in 2004.
- The project presents my programming skills how I do write code taking care of several optimisations.
- The game consists of controlling a ball and avoiding obstacles in order to reach a goal before the time runs out.
- Win condition: the player reached a goal
- Lose condition: the time to complete a level is elapsed

- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/ "GIMP - GNU Image Manipulation Program") & [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/ "Paint.NET - Free Software for Digital Photo Editing") for making graphics,
